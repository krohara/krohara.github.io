        <p>Hi and Welcome!  I’m Kelsey, and I’m the foodie behind this blog. 
        This is where I write, cook, and post about delicious food. 
        Currently, I’m a university student who studies by day and blogs at night. 
        I think you can imagine my sleep schedule... </p>
        
        <p>I’m a food enthusiast with an appetite for almost anything. 
        I love to bake desserts and cook comfort-styled meals, but I’m not strict about what I eat. 
        I will try anything from spicy calamari to pad thai. Any and all food is welcome! </p>
        
        <p>On this blog you will find: reviews, recipes, photos (aka food porn), and daily posting discussing any topics relating to food. 
        I will be experimenting with videos by recording my recipes, tasting new restaurants in Wisconsin, and interview local chefs about their process and 
        how they create their dishes. Let me know if you want to learn more about me, check out my
        <a href="http://www.facebook.com/kelsey.ohara1/"> Facebook</a> page or my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/irishkelso/">Instagram</a>.</p>
       
    	<h2>Passion for Food</h2>
        <p>I think it’s difficult to find someone who doesn’t love food. 
        Whether it’s cooking, baking, or just eating, everyone can find something enjoyable in food. 
        For me, my passion started through my mom. She wasn’t the world’s best chef, but she would always 
        tried to incorporate me in the kitchen from a young age. </p>
        
        <p>I was ten years old when I made my first full meal for my family 
        (even though it was pasta noodles with butter and steamed broccoli), and 
        ever since then, I have strived to get creative in the kitchen and cook more than ever.</p>
        
        <h2>Cooking on a Budget</h2>
        <p>Even though my love for cooking followed me through high school and into college, 
        I know my style had to adjust according to my busy schedule and my <i> wallet. </i>
        With less time and less money, I’ve learn to how to prep meals while working, 
        usually for less than $2.00 per meal. And I want to pass on my tips and tricks to you.</p>
        <p>I really want to help out my readers as much as I can!
         Below I have attached some of the most helpful websites and articles I’ve used for meal prepping
        and grocery shopping on a budget. </p>
